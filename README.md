# is znc-0.8 ready yet

This is just a small zite (0net site) that can be used to track
progress towards next major version.

## develop

- launch `zeronet-conservancy` using `--ui-ip-protect off --debug-unsafe` flags
- `npm run dev -- --port 8888` (or use different port to taste)
- open http://localhost:8888
